# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Cesare

## ðŸ’» I'm currently working on:
- Studying physics at Alma Mater Studiorum, in Bologna.
- Dunsel Network, a community based social network, based on MERN technologies.
- C++ plugin development with JUCE framework.
- Various other freelance projects on [Fiverr](https://it.fiverr.com/cesaresabattini).

### ðŸ¤– Check out my horribly unpleasant portfolio website I created and admire <br> how low a show off dude can push himself!
[Good Luck](https://fullstackdunsel.com/)
and here's the [repo](https://github.com/CesareSabattini/fullstackdunsel-portfolio).
